zorix/models/feature_analysis.py

Feature ablation and feature stability (Priority 1 of this phase).

Feature ablation here is implemented via permutation importance
(sklearn.inspection.permutation_importance): each feature's values are
independently shuffled and the drop in held-out performance is measured.
This is a standard, efficient stand-in for "remove the feature and
retrain" ablation — it isolates each feature's marginal contribution
without the cost of N full retrains, and unlike raw
`.feature_importances_` it is measured on held-out data, not training
data, so it isn't inflated by overfitting.

Feature stability measures whether importance rankings are consistent
across walk-forward folds (i.e., whether a feature that looks important
is a persistent, real relationship, or noise from a single lucky split).
